# Expense Management System

## Problem Statement
Companies often struggle with manual expense reimbursement processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack transparency.  
There is no simple way to:
- Define approval flows based on thresholds.
- Manage multi-level approvals.
- Support flexible approval rules.

## Core Features

### Authentication & User Management
- On first login/signup:
  - A new Company (in the environment-selected country’s currency) and Admin User are auto-created.
- Admin can:
  - Create Employees & Managers.
  - Assign and change roles → Employee, Manager.
  - Define manager relationships for employees.

### Expense Submission (Employee Role)
- Employee can:
  - Submit expense claims (Amount, Category, Description, Date, etc.)
  - Amount can be different from the company’s currency.
  - View their expense history (Approved, Rejected).

### Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin Role)
- Expense is first approved by the manager if the **IS MANAGER APPROVER** field is checked.
- When multiple approvers are assigned, Admin can define their sequence.
  - Example:
    - Step 1 → Manager
    - Step 2 → Finance
    - Step 3 → Director
- Expense moves to the next approver only after the current one approves/rejects.

Managers can:
- View expenses waiting for approval.
- Approve/Reject with comments.

### Conditional Approval Flow
Approval Rule supports:
- **Percentage rule**: e.g., If 60% of approvers approve → Expense approved.
- **Specific approver rule**: e.g., If CFO approves → Expense auto-approved.
- **Hybrid rule**: Combine both (e.g., 60% OR CFO approves).
- Combinations of multiple approvers + conditional rules are supported.

### Role Permissions
- **Admin**: Create company, manage users, set roles, configure approval rules, view all expenses, override approvals.
- **Manager**: Approve/reject expenses, view team expenses, escalate as per rules.
- **Employee**: Submit expenses, view their own expenses, check approval status.

## Additional Features
- **OCR for receipts** (auto-read)
  - Employees can scan a receipt, and the OCR algorithm auto-generates expense fields (amount, date, description, expense type, etc.).
- **APIs**:
  - Country & Currency: [RestCountries API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,currencies)
  - Currency Conversion: [Exchange Rate API](https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/{BASE_CURRENCY})
