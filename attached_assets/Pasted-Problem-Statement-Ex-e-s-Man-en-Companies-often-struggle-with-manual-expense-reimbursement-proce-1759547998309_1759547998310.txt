Problem Statement :- Ex e s Man en
Companies often struggle with manual expense reimbursement processes that are
time-consuming, error-prone, and lack transparency. There is no simple way to:
Define approval flows based on thresholds.
Manage multi-level approvals
Support flexible approval rules
Core Features
Authentication & User Management
On first login/signup:
○ A new Company (in the environment selected country’s currency should
get set) and Admin User are auto-created.
Admin can:
○ Create Employees & Managers.
○ Assign and change roles → Employee, Manager.
○ Define manager relationships for employees.
Expense Submission (Employee Role)
Employee can:
○ Submit expense claims (Amount [can be different from company’s currency],
Category, Description, Date) etc
○ View their expense history (Approved, Rejected).
Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin Role)
NOTE: The expense is first approved by his manager, if the IS MANAGER
APPROVER field is checked.
When multiple approvers are assigned, Admin can define their sequence.
○ Example:
Step 1 → Manager
○ Step 2 → Finance
○ Step 3 → Director
Expense moves to the next approver (approval request generated in next
approver’s account) only after the current one approves or rejects.
Managers can:
○ View expenses waiting for approval.
○ Approve/Reject with comments.
Conditional Approval Flow
Approval Rule supports:
○ Percentage rule: e.g., If 60% of approvers approve → Expense approved.
○ Specific approver rule: e.g., If CFO approves → Expense auto-approved.
○ Hybrid rule: Combine both (e.g., 60% OR CFO approves).
There can be a combination of both flows(Multiple approvers + Conditional)
together as well.
Role Permissions
Admin Create company (auto on signup), manage users, set roles, configure approval
rules, view all expenses, override approvals
Manager Approve/reject expenses (amount visible in company’s default currency), view
team expenses, escalate as per rules
Employee Submit expenses, view their own expenses, check approval status
Additional features :
OCR for receipts (auto-read)
○ Employees can just scan a receipt and using OCR algorithm the expense gets
autogenerated with all necessary fields like amount, date, description, expense
lines, expense type, name of restaurant(for e.g) where this expense was done.
